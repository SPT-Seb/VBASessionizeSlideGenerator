# VBASessionizeSlideGenerator
VBA project used to populate a PowerPoint PPTX file based on session content extracted at Excel format from Sessionize (see https://sessionize.com/ ) portal. 
Build for aOS Community usage (see https://aos.community/) to generate pictures for each speakers during events
By the way, this is a good way to understand how to use VBA to provision PowerPoint content ;)
